Day - 8
LC - 7 - https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/


Day - 9
LC - 9 - https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/  
	Approach1- using stringbuilder reverse method 
	Approach2- by converting a number using mod and division to reverse then compair it by original number.
	
Day - 10 
Problem1 - ArmstrongNumber
	GFG - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/armstrong-numbers2727/1
	Approach1 - using the digit(using mod 10) multiply 3 times and keep the sum  now for next iteration divide by 10 for next digit

Problem2 - Count digits
	GFG - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-digits5716/1
	Approach1 - each digit mod with original number if it is equals 0 increase count 



Recursion Problems
=====================
LeetCode125 - https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/
Approach  1 & 2 

LeetCode 509 - https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/
Approach1 
	- using two pointer variable prev and current variable i.e. 0 & 1 by Looping from 2 till N calculating sum updated prev & curr 
	- return the result in curr as it points to the updated nth fibbonaci number
Approach2 
	- base case will be the first two value rest will be computed based on recursion call for n-1 & n-2 & 
	- by summing both will get the updated nth fibbonaci number
	
Problem 3 - Basic print problem using recursion & backtracking
	- print name till n times
	- print 1 to n using both recursion & backtracking
	- print n to 1 using both recursion & backtracking
	- Sum of first n natural numbers (using parameterised & functional recursion)
	- factorial of number (using parameterised & functional recurson)
	
Question 8 - Reverse an array using recursion
Question 9 - Check whether the string is palindrome or not
